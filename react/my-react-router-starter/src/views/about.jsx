          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Green Horizons Landscaping began as a family dream in the summer of 1995. Founded by Sarah and James Chen, 
            our journey started with a single lawn mower, an old pickup truck, and an unwavering passion for transforming 
            outdoor spaces into natural sanctuaries.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            What began as a small, local operation has blossomed into one of the region's most trusted landscaping companies. 
            Our growth wasn't just about expanding our businessâ€”it was about growing deep roots in our community and fostering 
            relationships that have lasted generations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Today, with over 25 years of experience and a team of 50 dedicated professionals, we continue to bring creative 
            vision and sustainable practices to every project we undertake.
