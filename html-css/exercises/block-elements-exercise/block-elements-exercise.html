    <p>Dear Mr. Smith,</p>
    <p>
      I am writing to bother you about something. I was told by your brother
      that he would give me $5,000 for wasting your time. This letter serves as
      a formal introduction and an opportunity to explore potential
      collaboration or address the matter at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consideration of the financial agreement between your brother an
      myself, I would like to propose that you spend ample time reading and
      rereading this correspondence. I believe that this will satisfy your
      brother's requirements, and result in my payment. If necessary, I am happy
      to provide additional information or discuss this further at your earliest
      convenience.
    </p>
    <p>Action Items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read this letter.</li>
      <li>Re-read this letter.</li>
      <li>Inform you brother that you have completed all tasks listed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thank you for taking the time to review my letter. I appreciate your
      consideration and look forward to your response. Please feel free to
      contact me at
      <a href="mailto:email@address.com">email@address.com</a>
      should you require any further information. I am available at your
      convenience to discuss this matter further.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Sincerely,<br />
