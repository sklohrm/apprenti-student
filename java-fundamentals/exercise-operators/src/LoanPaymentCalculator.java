//        Calculate Monthly Payment using the Formula
//        monthlyPayment = (loanAmount√ó(interestRate/100)/12)
//        1. Use Assignment Operators:
//             Increase loanAmount by $5,000 (+=).
//             Reduce the annualInterestRate by 1% (-=).
//             Increase loanTermYears by 1 (++).
//
//         2. Use Comparison Operators:
//             Check if the loanAmount exceeds $30,000.
//             Check if the monthlyPayment is more than $500.
//
//          3. Use Logical Operators:
//            Determine if the loan is affordable (monthly payment is below $500 AND
//                    term is over 3 years).
//            Determine if the loan is expensive (monthly payment is above $700 OR
//                    interest rate is over 6%).
//
//           4. Print all results.
