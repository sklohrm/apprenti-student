//  Decisions Exercise
//        Objective
//        Create a text-based adventure game where the player explores a mysterious cave.
//                Use if statements, else-if chains, nested ifs, and switch statements to control the
//        story and outcomes.
//                Requirements
//        Your game should include:
//        1. A starting prompt where the player chooses to enter the cave or leave.
//        2. A decision inside the cave (e.g., choosing between two paths: left or right).
//        3. A nested decision inside one of the paths (e.g., fight or flee from a mysterious
//        figure).
//        4. A switch statement allowing the player to select an artifact with different
//        outcomes.
//        5. Multiple endings based on the player's choices.
//        6. User input handling with Scanner for decisions.
