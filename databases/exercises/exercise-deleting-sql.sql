-- Part 1: Delete a Single Record
-- 1. Write a SELECT query to find the product with the name 'Calendar 2023'.
SELECT *
FROM Product
WHERE ProductName = 'Calendar 2023';

-- 2. Use a DELETE statement to remove that product from the table.
DELETE FROM Product
WHERE ProductName = 'Calendar 2023';


-- Part 2: Delete Multiple Records
-- 3. Write a SELECT query to preview all products in the 'Stationery' category.
SELECT *
FROM Product p
         JOIN ProductCategory pc ON p.CategoryId = pc.CategoryId
WHERE pc.CategoryName = 'Stationery';

-- 4. Use a DELETE statement to remove all products in that category.
DELETE FROM Product
WHERE CategoryId = 2;

-- Part 3: Handle Foreign Key Dependencies
-- 5. Try to delete the 'Books' category from the ProductCategory table.
SELECT * FROM ProductCategory;
DELETE FROM ProductCategory
WHERE CategoryId = 1;

-- â€¢ What happens? Record the error message (if any).
-- The Delete fails because CategoryId is a foreign key on the Product table and there are
-- record on that table that are using that key.
# [23000][1451] Cannot delete or update a parent row:
#     a foreign key constraint fails (`code_along`.`product`,
#     CONSTRAINT `product_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`CategoryId`) REFERENCES `productcategory` (`CategoryId`))

-- 6. Now safely remove the 'Books' category by deleting its related products first.
DELETE FROM Product
WHERE CategoryId = 1;

DELETE FROM ProductCategory
WHERE CategoryId = 1;

SELECT * FROM Product;
SELECT * FROM ProductCategory;
